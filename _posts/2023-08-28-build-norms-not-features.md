I bet you've experienced what I call "Shift-Enter anxiety."
In a new app, will the Enter key create a new paragraph,
or will it prematurely send your message?
With this micro-stress, I must make a guess:
does it look like this app wants long-form writing?
Is the input box large?
Are other people posting multiple paragraphs?
If so, I hit Enter, and pray for a new paragraph.

But the effect also works in reverse.
If Enter creates a new paragraph, I'll write longer messages.
[Defaults are powerful!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nudge_theory)
Then, by posting my longer message,
I help build the social norm that _this is a place for long-form_.
Defaults in multi-user platforms are all-powerful:
first they determine individual behavior,
and then this determines group behavior.

At Slite, we're building an async work platform.
But instead of building social _features_, we build [social _norms_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_norm).
Social norms are shared expectations of how to work together.
"Async" and "long-form" are not features, they're norms.
We can't build them directly, but we can help build them with defaults and nudges.

The Enter key is one example:
in Slack it sends your message,
but in Slite it creates a new paragraph.
We default to docs instead of messages.
We default to emails instead of realtime notifications.
Teamwork becomes less chat culture, more [Amazon memo culture](https://thehustle.co/02162021-amazon-writing/).

If you're selling a collaboration product, you're not selling features.
You're selling norms.
Remember [Google Wave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Wave),
where the limit was your imagination,
but no one knew what they were expected to do?
It's justifiably dead.
When I use Slack,
I need the _other_ people using Slack to use Slack how I expect people to use Slack.
If the servers go down, `#ops` is not async!

Most comms products are technically generic,
and instead differentiated by norms.
Take Tinder and add "for trainspotters": bam, new dating app.
Or compare Slite to Slack:
a very different experience, but a similar technical structure:
a sidebar with "channels", "Discussions" like Slack threads, and "docs" like Slack Posts.
The difference is the defaults.

Instead of building features, try building norms.
"In Q3, we're building a chat-less-after-work norm.
In Q4, we'll deprecate the default-private-chat norm."
Which social norms are you selling?
Do your defaults nudge people towards those norms?
Which tiny tweaks can radically change the culture?
Examine your defaults, and build your norms!
