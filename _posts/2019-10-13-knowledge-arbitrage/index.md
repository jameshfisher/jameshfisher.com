In finance, arbitrage is where you know of a price difference between two markets, 
and exploit this by selling in the higher-price market and/or buying in the lower-price market.

In knowledge work, arbitrage is where you know of an information difference between two pools of knowledge / aggregators, and exploit this by bringing the knowledge/information from one pool to another.

Examples of pools:

* Hacker News
* /r/programming
