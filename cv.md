## EXPERIENCE

**2021 – current:
Stealth start-up;
details on request.**

**<span class="details">Apr. </span>2020 – <span class="details">Feb. </span>2021:
CEO at [**Vidrio**](https://vidr.io/),
my own app and company.**
Vidrio lets you make presentations with a screen recording and webcam.
Grew the company from $0 revenue to a maximum of $1600/month.
<span class="details">
Built macOS and Windows versions,
built website and marketing,
et cetera.
Key tech:
[Swift](https://www.swift.org/),
[Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/),
[WebGL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebGL).
</span>

**<span class="details">Jun. </span>2018 – <span class="details">Apr. </span>2020:
Technical Product Manager for [Pusher Channels](https://pusher.com/channels)
at [**Pusher**](https://pusher.com/).**
Companies use Pusher Channels to add realtime features to their apps
(e.g. chat messages, or stock ticker updates, or New York Times live election coverage).
I moved into product management
to help grow the product.
During my time we grew revenue from ~$8M ARR to ~$12M ARR.
<span class="details">
We had very limited resources and this was
an exercise in growing a product without adding new features.
I was the key link between Engineering, Sales and Marketing,
and the public representative of the product in many sales opportunities.
</span>

**<span class="details">Mar. </span>2016 – <span class="details">Jun. </span>2018:
Software Engineer at [Pusher](https://pusher.com/).**

* <span class="details">Mar. </span>2016 - 2018:
  Engineer on the [Pusher Channels](https://pusher.com/channels) team,
  working on scalability and reliability.
  <span class="details">
  [The system typically delivered 200,000 messages every second](https://making.pusher.com/how-pusher-channels-has-delivered-10000000000000-messages/).
  I was on the on-call rota.
  Key server-side tech:
  [Ruby on Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/),
  [Redis](https://redis.io/),
  [MySQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MySQL),
  [Puppet](https://puppet.com/),
  [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/),
  [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/),
  [Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/).
  Also maintained several client libraries.
  </span>
* <span class="details">Mar. – Jun. </span>2016:
  Adding message history to [Pusher Channels](https://pusher.com/channels)
  using Haskell and Raft.
  <span class="details">
  Channels used [Redis Pub/Sub](https://redis.io/topics/pubsub) as an internal message bus,
  but this has no reliable message history.
  Pusher had built a replacement message bus
  that used a custom [Raft](https://raft.github.io/) implementation for consistency and availability.
  This was written in [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/).
  I researched high latencies in the system,
  [finding that the root cause was garbage collection in GHC](https://making.pusher.com/latency-working-set-ghc-gc-pick-two/).
  This finding went surprisingly viral,
  and also sort of killed the whole project.
  Key tech:
  [Haskell (GHC)](https://www.haskell.org/),
  [QuickCheck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QuickCheck).
  </span>
* 2016 - 2017:
  Building [Pusher Beams](https://pusher.com/beams).
  Companies use Beams to send push notifications
  to Apple, Android and web clients.
  <span class="details">
  Key tech:
  [Go](https://go.dev/),
  [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/).
  Also built several client libraries.
  </span>
* Much public representation of Pusher:
  gave [several talks at conferences](/speaking);
  maintained [Pusher's engineering blog](https://making.pusher.com/)
  and wrote several posts;
  organized [Pusher's London meetup](https://www.meetup.com/the-realtime-guild/);
  ran our internal coding bootcamp for Sales and Marketing employees.

**<span class="details">May </span>2014 – <span class="details">Feb. </span>2016:
Software Pilot at [**Trifork**](http://www.trifork.com/).**
Trifork is an international software consultancy
and "pilot" is a funny word for consultant.
I worked with many clients, including:

* 2014:
  Rebuilt the account system at a large global bookmaker,
  solving its scalability problems.
  <span class="details">
  Account activity at a bookmaker is extremely spiky:
  think of betting during the Grand National!
  Key tech:
  [Java Spring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spring_Framework),
  [Symfony](https://symfony.com/),
  [Riak](https://riak.com/riak/),
  [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/),
  [Puppet](https://puppet.com/).

  </span>
* 2015-16:
  Worked with [Container Solutions](https://www.container-solutions.com/)
  and [Cisco Cloud Services](https://www.cisco.com/c/en_uk/solutions/cloud/index.html)

  [ElasticSearch for Mesos](https://github.com/mesos/elasticsearch) and
  [Logstash for Mesos](https://github.com/mesos/logstash).

**<span class="details">Jan. – May </span>2014:
Software Engineer at [**Arqiva WiFi**](https://web.archive.org/web/20140326072920/http://arqivawifi.com/internet-access-wireless-services-providers/).**
Arqiva provided white-label public WiFi (e.g. the free public WiFi at Heathrow airport).
<span class="details">
Our team rebuilt the 'captive portal'
(that annoying login page you see when you connect to free public WiFi).
I created the feature that gave you free public WiFi access
if you were willing to download an app or watch a video.
I wrote the functional and performance tests for the captive portal using [JMeter](https://jmeter.apache.org/).
(On the side,
I also built Arqiva's revenue tracker,
which gathered messy revenue data from heterogeneous, ancient sources.)
Key tech:
[PHP](https://www.php.net/) and
[MySQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MySQL).
</span>

**<span class="details">May </span>2012 – <span class="details">Sep </span>2013:

Traditional publishers use YUDU to create online facsimiles of their magazines and books
(think: PDF reader on steroids with cool "page turn" animations).
I was the lead in a team of four developers
working alongside a team at [Softwire](https://www.softwire.com/),
a software consultancy.
<span class="details">
I worked in product management, design, development, and maintenance.
I maintained the two front-ends,
a [Flash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Flash) version for the web,
and an [Adobe AIR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_AIR) version for desktop, Android, OS X, and iOS.
I also led a major redesign of [the management interface](https://publisher.yudu.com/).
Key tech:
[Java Spring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spring_Framework);
[Ramaze](https://github.com/Ramaze/ramaze) (a dead fork of [Ruby on Rails](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruby_on_Rails));
[Oracle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oracle_Database),
[MySQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MySQL),
[jQuery](https://jquery.com/),
[Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/).

Director and Secretary of [Lexden Montessori](https://web.archive.org/web/20210306074024/https://lexdenmontessori.com/),
a nursery in Colchester.**
<span class="details">
I started the nursery with my mum in 2006.
I worked in business planning,
market research and advertising,
administration and secretarial duties,
and web design and maintenance for [lexdenmontessori.com](https://web.archive.org/web/20210306074024/https://lexdenmontessori.com/),

with shelter, health-care, and help in their education and careers.
</span>

**2010:
Branding for [**Pembroke House**](https://pembrokehouse.sc.ke/),
a private Kenyan prep school.**
<span class="details">
As of 2021, they're still using the logo and brand that I designed.
In the words of their Commercial Director,
'James has worked with me on new brand designs
for Harambee Schools Kenya (see below), a charity,
and Pembroke House school, a prep school.
In both cases his work was of the highest quality,
and reflected a passion for design,
but also for getting under the skin of the organisation he is designing for.
I wouldn't hesitate to use James again for any design projects that I might have.'
</span>

**2010:
Award-winning brand and web design for [**Harambee Schools Kenya**](https://web.archive.org/web/20120723045033/http://www.hsk.org.uk/),
a charity building schools around Gilgil in rural Kenya.**
<span class="details">
[GWS Media gave the website an award](https://web.archive.org/web/20120628010313/http://onlinemarketing.gwsmedia.com/2010/11/2nd-objective-of-charity-website-design.html),
commending its 'plain, clear English; striking design, and beautiful images.'
The new branding and website brought in at least **£53,000 of funding**,
including from UBM (the global media and comms giant)
and [HSBC](https://www.hsbc.co.uk/), who made HSK their official corporate charity after finding the website.
</span>
