Experiment:
Find a task that can be completed in ~3 mins

* Group A (control): "On the next slide, you'll be asked to complete a task"
* Group B: "On the next slide, you'll be asked to complete a simple task"
* Group C: "On the next slide, you'll be asked to complete a tricky task"

How does the inclusion of the word "simple" or "tricky" affect the success rate in the task?
