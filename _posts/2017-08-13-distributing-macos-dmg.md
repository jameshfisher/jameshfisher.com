  Distributing Vidrio outside the Mac App Store with a signed .app in a .dmg,
  and creating custom download badges to comply with Apple's guidelines.

Previously I had only offered Vidrio for download through the Mac App Store. Now I'm distributing a .dmg with a signed .app. Vidrio is still free to use. Next, I prettified [the Vidrio download page](https://vidr.io/download) with the official "Download on the Mac App Store" badge. I hacked together another image for .dmg download, in direct contravention of Apple's badge usage guidelines.
