[A few days ago, I suggested using "diff views" in docs and blogs](/2017/11/23/diff-views/),
and wrote that "our tools are not equipped to manually write diffs."
My friend and colleague [Craig Frost](https://twitter.com/_ctfd_uk/status/934767358559780864)
then tweeted that

> If you use GitHub Flavoured Markdown,
> you can achieve diff views by beginning a line with `+` or `-`
> and setting `diff` as the language.
> Of course, this does mean forfeiting actual syntax highlighting ðŸ˜·

Cool! With some appropriate CSS set, this works:

```diff
 function JimPromise() {
+  this.isFulfilled = false;
   this.callbacks = [];
 }

 JimPromise.prototype.fulfill = function(value) {
+  this.isFulfilled = true;
+  this.value = value;
   this.callbacks.forEach(cb => cb(value));
 };

 JimPromise.prototype.registerCallback = function(cb) {
+  if (this.isFulfilled) {
+    cb(this.value);
+  } else {
     this.callbacks.push(cb);
+  }
 };
```

As Craig mentions,
by changing the language to `diff`,
I lost the syntax highlighting for the base language (JavaScript).
Our tools are still poorly equipped for displaying diffs,
but the above approach is quick and easy.
I'll use it in future.
