title: How to write an essay

Ten years ago I took a break from writing essays to tell everyone else how to write essays.
These "maxims and arrows"
(as I pretentiously called them in my younger days -
a clumsy nod towards the Nietzsche I was reading at the time)
served me well.
I don't use these principles very much today.
It turns out industry is more interested in truth than in rhetorical dances.
But I suspect they still work well today if you're studying an arts degree.
Here, child. These were my father's maxims. They are yours now. Use them wisely.

* Arguing something well is more important than arguing something right.
* Interesting arguments are better than “good” ones.
* Ridiculous arguments are more interesting than sensible ones.
* Rhetoric is more enjoyable to read than substance.
* You are not investigating reality, you are creating it.
* Identify the enemy. If there is no enemy, create one.
* Destroying the opposing argument is more important than constructing your own.
  Destruction is more interesting to watch than construction.
* If you can't destroy it, ruthlessly ignore it.
* If you can't ignore it, misrepresent it.
* Moderation and balance are not virtues.
* Don't turn back even if you are on the wrong path.
* If your sentences seem short, join them together with semi-colons.
* The more fragmented the sentences according to word, the better.
* If your paragraphs seem short, delete the line break.
* Link one paragraph to the next, however vague the link.
* _Everything looks profound in italics._
* Use foreign text in its original without translation.
* The less relevant the foreign phrase, the better.
  For instance, 'Aio, quantitas magna frumentorum est' ('Yes, that is a very large amount of corn')
  belongs in any essay.
  'Apage Satanas' ('Begone, Satan') is an adequate conclusion.
  (I believe this point was a contribution from my friend Peter.)
* If translation of foreign text is needed, instead use “This obviously demonstrates ...” .
* Constantly state your achievements throughout. ('We have now demonstrated...')
* No-one ever checks citations.
* If you're making a ridiculous point or a controversial one,
  and you're sure that no-one would have been stupid enough to make the same point before,
  just write vaguely that 'many critics/historians/scientists believe' it.
* Everything is appropriate for citation apart from Wikipedia.
  Newspapers. Radio 4. Song lyrics. Paintings.
* Rather than citing Wikipedia, just appropriate its own citations.
* Asserting something confidently enough will suffice for demonstrating it.
* Asserting something enough times will suffice for demonstrating it.
* Use every logical fallacy you can get away with to further your argument,
  and explicitly identify those of others.
* Every argument has to have axioms. Choose whichever are appropriate.
* All arguments are arguments of definition. Choose whatever definitions are appropriate.
* End where you started. Circular logic justifies the unjustifiable.
