title: "What is `ssize_t` in C?"
---

I previously covered the `size_t` type in C]({% post_url 2016-11-29-size_t_iterator %}), which is used to represent the size of an allocated block of memory. But lots of C functions use a type called `ssize_t`. What's that? What is the extra `s`?

In short, `ssize_t` is the same as `size_t`, but is a signed type - read `ssize_t` as "signed `size_t`". `ssize_t` is able to represent the number `-1`, which is returned by several system calls and library functions as a way to indicate error. For example, the `read` and `write` system calls:

```c
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <unistd.h>

ssize_t read(int fildes, void *buf, size_t nbyte);
ssize_t write(int fildes, const void *buf, size_t nbyte);
```
