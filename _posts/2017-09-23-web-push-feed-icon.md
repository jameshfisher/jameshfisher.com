Lots of sites have RSS feeds.
They link to them with those little orange icons: <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/43/Feed-icon.svg"/>.
They probably remind you of an earlier, simpler web.
You probably don't use them, because, like most people now, you don't use an RSS reader.

But maybe you'd use web push notifications.
