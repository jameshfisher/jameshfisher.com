  Use `nc` (netcat) to create a web server that returns custom HTTP
  responses.
---

The netcat tool `nc` can operate as a TCP client.
Because HTTP works over TCP, `nc` can be used as an HTTP server!
Because `nc` is a UNIX tool,
we can use it to make custom web servers:
servers which return any HTTP headers you want,
servers which return the response very slowly,
servers which return invalid HTTP,
etc.
You can also use `nc` as a quick-and-dirty static file server.

Here's an example.
Run your web server by
telling `nc` to listen for new connections on port 8000:

```console
$ nc -l 8000
```

Then run your web browser.
Here I use `curl` but you could also use Chrome etc:

```console
$ curl localhost:8000/index.html
```

Back at `nc`, you'll see the HTTP request come through from `curl`:

```console
$ nc -l 8000
GET /index.html HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost:8000
User-Agent: curl/7.54.0
Accept: */*

```

`nc` is now waiting for you to type the response!
Type out the following:

```
HTTP/1.1 200 Everything Is Just Fine
Server: netcat!
Content-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8

<!doctype html>
<html>
<body>
<h1>A webpage served with netcat</h1>
</body>
</html>
```

Once you start typing the HTML,
you'll see it come line-by-line in your `curl` command.
When you've finished typing the HTTP response,
hit `Ctrl-D`.
This tells `nc` to close the TCP connection and exit.
The server is no more!

To run a persistent static server without typing anything in,
write your HTTP response to a file like `index.http`:

```
$ cat index.http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8
Server: netcat!

<!doctype html>
<html><body><h1>A webpage served by netcat</h1></body></html>
```

Then run `nc` in an infinite loop to serve this file for every response:

```
$ while true; do cat index.http | nc -l 8000; done
```

As an example of a "weird web server" you can make with `nc`,
you can simulate a very slow web server.
Use `pv --rate-limit 10` to read the file at 10 bytes per second:

```
while true; do pv --rate-limit 10 index.http | nc -l 8000; done
```

If you view this in Chrome,
you can see Chrome's "progressive rendering"!
