  Disastrous interview experience. Unable to enter building. Was this a test to weed out the idiots? Ran away and never came back.

When I was young, I had a job interview for a company on the fifth floor of a building. I pressed the buzzer on the door outside for them to let me up. Their intercom didn’t work properly so I couldn’t hear them well, but they buzzed me in. However, I couldn’t open the door in time. I found this embarrassing, but summoned the courage to buzz again. I don’t know what happened, but I didn’t get in that time either. I then waited for about ten minutes outside, stewing and sweating silently. In my imagination they were upstairs laughing at the candidate who couldn’t even work out how to get in the front door. Maybe this was “the door test” to weed out the idiots? I ran away back home and refused to answer any calls from them ever again.
