Ivy Lee was an early 20C "productivity consultant" who created a task/time management system now known as the "Ivy Lee method". It works like this:

1. At the end of the day, write down no more than six tasks to accomplish tomorrow. Rank them by importance.
1. Each day, work through the list in order.
1. Before writing your new list, scrap the old one.
