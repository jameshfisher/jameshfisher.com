summary: >-
  `static` in C can modify variable declarations inside and outside a function
  body, and function parameters.

Like `void`, the keyword `static` is another of those overloaded keywords. It has different meanings in different syntactic forms.

1: To modify a variable declaration _inside_ a function body, e.g.

```c
int incr(void) {
  static int ctr;
  ctr++;
  return ctr;
}
```

This example is equivalent to:

```c

int fresh_1;

int incr(void) {
  fresh_1++;
  return fresh_1;
}
```

... where `fresh_1` is a fresh variable, i.e. not used elsewhere in the program.

2: To modify a variable declaration _outside_ a function body, e.g.

```c
static int ctr;
int incr(void) {
  ctr++;
  return ctr;
}
```

This is also equivalent to

```c
int fresh_1;

int incr(void) {
  fresh_1++;
  return fresh_1;
}
```

where `fresh_1` is a fresh variable, i.e. not used elsewhere in the program (specifically, other _translation units_).

3: as a modifier to an array length in the type of a function parameter, e.g.:

```c
int foo(int bar[static 10]) {
  return bar[9];
}
```

Here, `static 10` means "`bar` points to an array of at least length 10".

A commenter on SO mentions a very useful trick: instead of taking an argument of type `struct foo *`, a function can instead take an argument of type `struct foo [static 1]`, which makes the stronger statement that `foo` points to memory of at least size `sizeof(struct foo)`. That is, `[struct 1]` is a way to annotate an argument as being non-null!

Unfortunately it seems you can't use this notation in general types. Is it exclusive to function parameters of the form `T x[static n]`?
