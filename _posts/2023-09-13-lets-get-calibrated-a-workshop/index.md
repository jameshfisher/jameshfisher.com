I ran [a workshop called _Let's Get Calibrated!_](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1-nTZsbPRk_TQs4U9-bVi9xfCUdT_BfCCXocBxywSljw/edit?usp=sharing).
It was designed to show:

* Why estimations and calibration are important, and what they even mean
* How to calibrate yourself, while learning some facts about the company

Here are the Google Slides.
You can run this workshop in your own company.
Just fill it in with facts from your company.
