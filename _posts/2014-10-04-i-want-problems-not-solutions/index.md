We live in a world obsessed with solutions.
Every article or paper claims to be a solution to something.
We award merit to an idea to the extent that it solves a problem.
Sometimes we even call something a ‘solution’
without ever stating what the problem is that it is a solution to.
Even in an intensely entrepreneurial space like Hacker News,
where the phrase ‘pain point’ is common,
almost every post is a proposed solution.
We tell people they are creating ‘solutions in search of problems,’
but how are they to know what the problems are?
Where are they listed?
