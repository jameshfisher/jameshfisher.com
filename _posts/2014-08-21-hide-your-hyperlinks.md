Like so many of us, I suffer from a neurological disorder known as _depth-first syndrome_.
The symptoms include an inability to complete tasks, and frequent episodes of transient global amnesia.
Those of us with this affliction have an instinctual attraction to hyper-links.
The symptoms are brought on by the presence of blue text, or underlining,
or even any slight typographical abnormality indicative of the presence of a link.
Sufferers of DFS describe the experience as similar to itching:
the link is an irritant, and the itch only gets steadily worse,
until the sufferer finally gives in to the primitive desire to scratch,
the unreasonable desire to â€¦ _click_.
