title: A calendar view for this blog
justification: Renewing my 'post every day' promise

I just spent two hours reformatting the homepage for this blog.
Previously, it was a long list of posts.
Now, it's formatted as a calendar:
rows are weeks,
columns are weekdays,
and one cell is one date.

This was not especially easy;
it was a fight against Jekyll's "Liquid" templating language.
So why did I bother?
The point of this is to emphasize my promise back in November:
_post every day_.
Previously, days where I did not post were hidden between the lines.
Now, those days show up as empty table cells,
and the days, weeks, and months that structure my life are reflected in the structure of the table.

During May, June and July, I barely posted at all.
This is visible as a void in the calendar.
I feel worse for it.
I'll try not to let it happen again.
