When all mining is done,
there will be a maximum of 21 million bitcoins in circulation.
Why was this number chosen?
My speculation:
21 million was chosen to ensure a sensible smallest unit
if Bitcoin were the world's exclusive currency.

The real unit of Bitcoin is not the bitcoin; it is the satoshi:
the satoshi is the unit used in transactions, and it is indivisible.
There will be 2.1e15 satoshis in circulation.
The indivisible unit in USD is the cent;
it's not really possible to sell items for fractions of a cent.
There are about 6e15 cents in circulation today (across all currencies).
Thus if everyone used Bitcoin,
the satoshi would be worth about 3 cents,
which the world has decided is a sensible minimum amount.

At this time, 1 BTC would be worth $2,800,000.
