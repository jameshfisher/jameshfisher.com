title: How to distribute a MacOS .dmg
justification: I'm making Vidrio available for download outside the Mac App Store

Previously I had only offered Vidrio for download through the Mac App Store. Now I'm distributing a .dmg with a signed .app. Vidrio is still free to use. Next, I prettified [the Vidrio download page](https://vidr.io/download) with the official "Download on the Mac App Store" badge. I hacked together another image for .dmg download, in direct contravention of Apple's badge usage guidelines.
