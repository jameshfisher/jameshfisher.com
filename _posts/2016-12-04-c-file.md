Consider:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
FILE * fopen(const char *restrict filename, const char *restrict mode);
```

`fopen` gives us a `FILE`, but what is a `FILE`?

First, `FILE` _used to be_ a macro, which is why it's capitalized.

Nowadays, it's a `typedef`, defined in `stdio.h`. On macOS, in `/usr/include/stdio.h`:

```c
typedef struct __sFILE {
        short   _file;          /* fileno, if Unix descriptor, else -1 */
        // ... more stuff ...
} FILE;
```

The rest of the definition has some buffers for doing `getc`, `ungetc`, etc.
