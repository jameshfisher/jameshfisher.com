title: "Adding Open Graph meta tags to jameshfisher.com"
tags: ["blog"]
---

My blog posts are auto-posted to Facebook,
but they look very plain when posted there.
Facebook uses [Open Graph](http://ogp.me/) tags
to determine how to display URLs,
and my blog was missing these.
My hope is that, starting with this post,
my auto-posts will look a little more enticing.

I added these Open Graph tags to every page (generated by Jekyll):

```html
{% raw %}<meta property="og:title" content="{{page.title}}"/>
<meta property="og:type" content="website"/>
<meta property="og:image" content="{{site.url}}/assets/jim_128.png"/>
<meta property="og:url" content="https://jameshfisher.com{{ page.url }}"/>
<meta property="og:description" content="{{ page.excerpt | strip_html }}"/>
<meta property="og:site_name" content="jameshfisher.com"/>{% endraw %}
```

Apparently `og:image` tags only work with absolute URLs,
not relative ones.
This is a bit annoying in combination with Jekyll `link`,
which generates relative URLs.
Here's hoping that Facebook finds the photo of me for this post's image.
