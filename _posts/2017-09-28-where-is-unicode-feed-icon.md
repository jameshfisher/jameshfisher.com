If you lived through the naughties, you know this icon:
![feed icon](https://www.mozilla.org/media/img/trademarks/feed-icon-14x14.2168a573d0d4.png).
It's the universal icon for RSS/Atom feeds.
It has [its own Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feed_icon).
It has [its own (unofficial) website](http://www.feedicons.com/).
[Its SVG version](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Feed-icon.svg)
is "one of the 100 most-used files on the English Wikipedia".

And yet this icon does not exist in Unicode.
There are much more frivolous icons in Unicode.
The famous example is U+1F4A9 PILE OF POO,
but there are much more questionable icons than that.
Check out [the pipeline](http://unicode.org/alloc/Pipeline.html) for amusing examples.
Why does the feed icon not exist in Unicode?
The Unicode Consortium themselves use the icon on [their homepage](http://www.unicode.org/)!

I've found one person who agrees with me:
[Victor Felder](https://github.com/vhf)
began [this proposal](https://github.com/vhf/unicode-syndication-proposal)
last year, but did not submit it.

Unicode is proposal-driven.
I'm going to work on a proposal for the feed icon.
The Unicode Consortium has [a page about proposals](http://unicode.org/pending/proposals.html).
