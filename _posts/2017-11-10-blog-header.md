title: "Adding a blog header"
justification: "I want a lower bounce rate."

My blog's "design" is intentionally very minimal.
I try to steer away from "bullshit minimal"
towards "[motherfucking website](http://motherfuckingwebsite.com/) minimal".
One example of minimality is the lack of any header on blog posts.
There's just the `<h1>title</h1>`, and away we go.

But people expect a header.
If someone wants to navigate to the homepage,
they look for a link in the header.
So, fine, I'll add one.
I added the photo of me on the left-hand side.
You can click it to go to the homepage.
