I often see stories associating software development with depression and other mental health issues.
A lot of people saw a 2013 talk by Greg Baugues
in which he talks about his bipolar disorder
and the possible suicide of one of his co-workers.
There are a lot of posts talking specifically about Aaron Swartz.
Thereâ€™s a website and forum devoted to the topic of developers with depression.
The perception amongst developers is that we are a high-risk group for depression and related disorders.
