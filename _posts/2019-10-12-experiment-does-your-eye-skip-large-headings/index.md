Theory:
"Large-text blindness"

Run an online experiment
Choose a body of text
Present it to people as a comprehension test
Two variants:

- V1: headings are large / visually distinct from body text
- V2: headings are basically same as body text

Question after reading:
"What was the heading of the second section?"

Hypothesis:
People read V2 headings more, and don't skip them.
