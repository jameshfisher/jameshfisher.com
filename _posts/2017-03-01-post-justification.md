title: Justifying posts
justification: >-
  I noticed in my monthly review that some posts were a bit random. Here is a
  possible technique for improving focus.

This month I have an experimental technique to improve the focus of my blogging. Posts should have a `justification` property, in which I justify the reason for the existence of the post. Typically this will refer back to one of my targets for the month. An example:

```yaml
justification: "I said I would learn how NAT works. It's a basic internet concept which comes up all the time at work. It's essential for understanding parts of WebRTC."
```

The `justification` property will appear at the bottom of the post, like this:

> _I wrote this post because I said I would learn how NAT works. It's a basic internet concept which comes up all the time at work. It's essential for understanding parts of WebRTC._

I won't _require_ the `justification` property. If it's missing, it'll say

> _I wrote this post because I felt like it._

It's important that this technique does not turn into self-shaming. If I want to write an off-the-wall post, I will. I jut hope this technique will provide a little extra focus.
