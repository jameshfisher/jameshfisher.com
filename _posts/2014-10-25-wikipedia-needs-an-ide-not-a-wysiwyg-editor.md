Wikipedia, if you haven’t heard of it already, is the world’s biggest software project.
At almost a billion lines, it’s twice as large as healthcare.gov.
It’s coded in a homegrown Turing-complete programming language,
and the full thirteen years of history is kept in a homegrown version control system.
The final built artifact — an online encyclopedia — gets more traffic than Twitter.
