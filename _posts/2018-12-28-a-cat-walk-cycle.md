title: "A cat walk cycle"

I spent a few hours trying my hand at a "walk cycle".
This is a video which can be looped to produce an infinite walk.
I chose a cat as the subject (Toupac, my girlfriend's family cat).
I used [this walk cycle guide](https://i-h2.pinimg.com/564x/fa/0e/83/fa0e839bf78980cced0aa0f6f89f7f88.jpg)
(actually for a dog but I assume dogs have similar gaits to cats).
I used a "pixel art" style,
which made this a bit simpler,
and makes it possible to use this in future for a retro game.
I made this using GIMP.
