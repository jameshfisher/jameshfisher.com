The `execve` system call is part of how new processes are created in UNIX. A call to `execve` replaces the current process image with a new process image. Example:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <unistd.h>
int main(void) {
  printf("Main program started\n");
  char* argv[] = { "jim", "jams", NULL };
  char* envp[] = { "some", "environment", NULL };
  if (execve("./sub", argv, envp) == -1)
    perror("Could not execve");
  return 1;
}
```

Running this program starts a process which prints some text, then replaces itself with a different program. In this example, the program is given by `"./sub"`, a path to the program. After executing `execve("./sub", ...)`, the process behaves like the program `./sub`. Here's the output, with a `./sub` program which prints its arguments and environment:

```
% cc main.c -o main
% ./main
Main program started
Sub program started with args: jim jams
Sub program environment:
some
environment
```

The full call is `execve(path, argv, env)`. The second argument provides the process's argument array (the `argv` seen in the second argument to `main` in the `./sub` program). The third argument provides the process's environment (the `environ` seen by the `./sub` program).

The `argv` and `envp` values are deliberately strange in this example. It is idiomatic to pass the program's name as its first argument, but, as this shows, this idiom can be broken: the program is `"./sub"`, but we pass the first argument `"jim"`. Thus the sub program never knows that it was executed from the program at `"./sub"`. The `envp` is strange because is it idiomatic to pass key-value strings in the environment, such as `"FOO=bar"`. Again, this is just an idiom, and it can be broken.

The `execve` call ordinarily never returns, since the process that called it is replaced. It only returns if it fails, in which case it returns `-1`.

Notice that `execve` does not create a _new_ process! 
So, how then can we get from one process to two, and so on? 
The answer is `fork` - another system call, 
[which I cover in the next post]({% post_url 2017-02-06-how-do-i-use-fork-in-c %}).
