title: Moving pictures

I used to have an image of me
on the homepage and on the side of each post.
I've upgraded it to a video of me standing still.
It's a moving picture.
Just like in Harry Potter.
My hope is that this "moving picture" is more engaging than a photo.
You have to stare for a while to discover what's in the video.

My partner filmed me for 30 seconds.
Using Premiere,
I trimmed 10 seconds out of this,
then did the classic looping video trick:
play it, then play it in reverse.
This trick works very well for such a video where nothing happens.
I embedded this video with:

```html
<video autoplay loop src="..." ...></video>
```

It's not the best video,
but it's a proof of concept.
I'll make a few more videos of the same kind.
I'd like the video to be more subtly moving,
so at first it's mistaken for an image.
I'd also like a higher quality video, at least 256px square.
Also, I need a haircut.
