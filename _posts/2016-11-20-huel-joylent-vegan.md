A while back I bought some [Huel](https://huel.com/), copying some colleagues. I've finally got through it. Now I want to buy some more, but first let's look at the competition.

There's a wide range:

```
               UK?  Vegan?  £/meal  Flavors        Result
Huel           Y    Y       £1.47   Vanilla, none
Soylent        N    Y       £1.55   none           Not in UK; more expensive
Joylent        Y    N       £1.43   quite a few    cheaper; but not vegan
Joylent vegan  Y    Y       £1.43   quite a few    cheaper, vegan, a few flavors
Mana                                               [Not researched]
Jake                                               [Not researched]
```

Of those, Huel and Joylent's vegan version stand out. I've gone for Joylent vegan.

The [Joylent T&Cs](https://www.joylent.eu/terms-and-conditions) are a bit scary. Apparently we're now legally friends. I wonder if these things have been read out in court yet.
