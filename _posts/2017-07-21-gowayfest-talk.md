Will Sewell and I gave our "Go garbage collector" talk at [GoWayFest](https://goway.io/) in Minsk.
We met quite a few people, such as
[Elena Grahovac](https://twitter.com/webdeva) who hosts [The Golang Show](http://golangshow.com/),
[Yuras Shumovich](https://twitter.com/shumovichy) who [already knew us from our GHC garbage collector blog post](https://www.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/4j0imi/ghc_cannot_achieve_low_latency_with_a_large/d32n6hm/),
and [Eugene Bolt](https://twitter.com/jekabolt), the first non-UK Vidrio user I've met.
It was a one-day conference on Friday,
but Will and I were out Thursday to Sunday,
so we got to do some tourism.
On Saturday, we were invited to Juno's VIP area at a rock festival, ["Rock Za Bobrov"](http://rock.bobrov.by/).
We travelled via Kiev both ways.
Minsk was surprisingly orderly (it's the "Russian Las Vagas" run by a semi-dictator obsessed with cleanliness)
whereas Kiev was a bit of a Wild West.
