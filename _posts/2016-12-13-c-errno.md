You may see references to `errno` in C code. This is defined in `<errno.h>` as:

```c
#define errno (*__error())
```

That is, `errno` dereferences a call to a function `__error`. This is defined as

```c
extern int * __error(void);
```

That is, a function which takes no arguments and returns a non-null pointer to the error number.

The [docs](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/errno.3.html) say

> `errno` is defined by the ISO C standard to be a modifiable lvalue of type `int`

That is, we should be able to assign to `errno`. This is possible, because `*V` is also an lvalue.

These details aside, `errno` is basically a global `int` value. Its value is set by some system calls. It's an assistant to the "return `-1`" idiom.
