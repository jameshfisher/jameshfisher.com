How do you judge the "size" of a cryptocurrency?
_Not_ by the price per coin - the coin is an arbitrary unit.
Nor by number of coins - again, the coin is arbitrary.
Instead by _market capitalization_.
"Market cap" is usually applied to _companies_, not cryptocurrencies.
The market cap of a company is its share price multipled by its number of shares.
The market cap of a company is the amount in USD it would cost to buy all of its shares.
Applied to a cryptocurrency, the market cap, a value in USD, is calculated as $/coin * number of coins.
The market capitalization of Bitcoin is the amount in USD you would have to pay to buy all Bitcoins.
Right now, that's about $75B.
Many sites like [CoinMarketCap](https://coinmarketcap.com/) track the "market cap" of big cryptos.

CoinMarketCap lists 1200 different cryptocurrencies.
The total market cap across all cryptos is $164B.
Their market cap follows a strong power law;
Bitcoin has almost half the entire market cap.

Here I'll look at the top 10.

| Crypto            | Market cap  | Year | Notes                                       |
|-------------------|-------------|------|---------------------------------------------|
| Bitcoin           | $75B        | 2009 | The original cryptocurrency. Proof-of-work. |
| Ethereum          | $32B        | 2014 | Scripting. Forked in 2016 due to "The DAO" bug. Will use proof-of-stake in future. |
| Bitcoin Cash      | $10B        | 2017 | Fork of Bitcoin. Larger block size limit. |
| Ripple            | $8B         | 2012 | Tokens represent other assets, e.g. fiat currency. Formal relationship to banks. |
| Litecoin          | $4B         | 2011 | Bitcoin, with some attempts to increase latency and throughput. |
| NEM               | $2.7B       | 2015 | Proof-of-importance. |
| Dash              | $2.7B       | 2014 | An associated DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization). |
| IOTA              | $2B         | 2016 | Uses a Markle DAG instead of a Merkle list. |
| Monero            | $1.9B       | 2014 | Uses "CryptoNote", which somehow is more anonymous. |
| Ethereum Classic  | $1.8B       | 2016 | The "non-fork" of Ethereum blockchain; accepts "The DAO" thefts. |
