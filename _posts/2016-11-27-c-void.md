  `void` in C has multiple meanings: as a return type to indicate no return
  value, as a parameter type to indicate no parameters, and as a pointer type to
  indicate a pointer to an unknown type.

What does `void` mean in C? I think it's confusing to think of it having a singular meaning. It is part of a number of unrelated syntactic forms, and should be understood separately in each:

* As a return "type". In the function declaration `void foo(int)`, the `void` signifies that "`foo` does not return a value".
* As a parameter type list. In the function declaration `char bar(void)`, the `void` signifies that "`bar` has zero parameters".
* As the target "type" of a pointer. In the declaration `void* baz`, the `void` signifies that "`baz` points to a value of unknown type".

It is confusing to call `void` a "type". There are positions where a normal type (`int`) can be used, but `void` cannot. For example, `int foo;` is a valid declaration, but `void foo;` is not. There are also positions where `void` can be used, but a normal type cannot. For example, `char foo(int) { return 'c'; }` is not a valid function definition.

The standard calls `void` an "incomplete type", but I find this unenlightening in the case of `char bar(void)`.
