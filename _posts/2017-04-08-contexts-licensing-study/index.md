  Implementing a 'free trial' for macOS apps involves a license-generation
  system on a server and a license-verification system in the app, plus storing
  the license data in the app's preferences file.

A simple way to charge for macOS apps is to add an up-front cost in the Mac App Store. But I don't want this for Vidrio. I think "free trial" or "freemium" models will be much more successful. The Mac App Store payment system also only works for a single platform, whereas I want Vidrio to be available on multiple platforms (e.g. Windows). Yet another reason is that I want to be able to experiment with policies such as subscription, and discounts for sharing.

Here's a study of [Contexts](https://contexts.co/) implements this. The user purchases a license key, enters it in-app, and then continues using the software. For this to work, the app needs a license-generation system on a server and a license-verification system in the app.

macOS apps store config data under `~/Library/Preferences/com.someapp.plist`. Property-list files can be in multiple formats: XML, binary, or JSON. All of the config property-list files seem to be in binary format. We can convert them to the XML format using `plutil -convert xml1 com.someapp.plist`. You should copy the file first, because this tool overwrites the input file.

The `com.contextsformac.Contexts.plist` file has a section like this (after conversion to XML):

```
<key>CTLicenseData</key>
<data>
PCFET0NU...GlzdD4=
</data>
```

The `<data>` section is base64-encoded, and when decoded looks like:

```xml
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple Computer//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
<plist version="1.0">

</plist>
```

This data originates from a file I received in an email:

So Contexts is using [FastSpring](https://fastspring.com/) for its licenses.

I believe Contexts is using [AquaticPrime](https://github.com/bdrister/AquaticPrime) to generate these asymmetrically signed license files. These are probably generated by FastSpring, [which has an AquaticPrime integration](https://support.fastspring.com/hc/en-us/articles/207438806-AquaticPrime-License-Generator); [FastSpring says](https://fastspring.com/features/purchases/)

> Our platform also supports several license key code generation products including AquaticPrime, ByteShield, CocoaFOB, GameShield, Quick License Manager (QLM), SoftwareKey System, CryptoLicensing, and SoftwareShield.

AquaticPrime seems old and semi-dead. Which things in that list are well-supported in 2017? The top ones in that list seem to be [SoftwareKey](https://www.softwarekey.com/product-list/), [CryptoLicensing](http://www.ssware.com/cryptolicensing/cryptolicensing_net.htm), and [GameShield](http://www.gameshield.com/Product). In a nutshell, they all look shite.
