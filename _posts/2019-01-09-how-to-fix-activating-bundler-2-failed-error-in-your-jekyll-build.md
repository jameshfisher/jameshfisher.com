This site is built using Jekyll,
and deployed on Netlify.
In 2019, the build mysteriously started breaking!
Here's the log:

```

Since the last successful build,
`Successfully installed bundler-1.17.3`
changed to `Successfully installed bundler-2.0.1`.
[Netlify's build image doesn't specify a version](https://github.com/netlify/build-image/blob/84aca9ba39e0ee86ba194760fbfc51a808f62543/Dockerfile#L240-L242),
and [Bundler just released a new major version, 2.0.1](https://rubygems.org/gems/bundler/versions/2.0.1).

So Bundler 2 doesn't work for my site.
But why?
The fix was to remove the last two lines from `Gemfile.lock`:

```
$ tail -2 Gemfile.lock
BUNDLED WITH
   1.14.6
```

Apparently, Bundler 2 fails if it finds a `Gemfile.lock` which was bundled with version 1.
Despite claiming to be backwards compatible.
(In which case, why the new major version number?)
