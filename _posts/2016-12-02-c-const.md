`const` is a keyword.
More specifically, `const` is a _type qualifier_.
Type qualifiers are part of C types.
In the type `int const`,
`const` is a type qualifier,
and `int` is a type _specifier_.
Here, `const` qualifies the type `int`.
Qualifiers change the semantics of the type in some way.
Other type qualifiers include `volatile` and `restrict`.

(Note you can also write `const int`,
which means the same thing as `int const`.
But should never write this.
Always write `const` in "postfix",
on the right-hand side of the type it is qualifying.
That you can write `const int` is a quirk of the C syntax which should not exist.)

How does `int const` differ from `int`?
A value of type `T const` cannot be assigned to,
except when initialized.
For example:

```c
int main(void)
{
  int i = 3;         // OK
  int const ci = 5;  // OK; assignment at initialization
  i = 7;             // OK
  ci = 9;            // ERROR; assigning to `const` value
  return 0;
}
```

You cannot assign to a `const` value, even if assigning the same value:

```c
int main(void)
{
  int const ci = 5;
  ci = 5;            // ERROR, even though same value
  return 0;
}
```

You cannot assign to a `const` value, even if it was not initialized at declaration:

```c
int main(void)
{
  int const ci;      // no initializer
  ci = 5;            // ERROR; cannot assign to `const` value even though uninitialized
  return 0;
}
```

`const` can sit in more complex types
to express ideas like "pointer to an unassignable int",
or "unassignable pointer to an assignable int",
or "an array of unassignable integers".
Some examples:

```c
typedef int const int_const;                      // An unassignable int
typedef int * int_ptr;                            // An assignable pointer to an assignable int
typedef int_const * int_const_ptr;                // An assignable pointer to an unassignable int
typedef int * const int_ptr_const;                // An unassignable pointer to an assignable int
typedef int_const * const int_const_ptr_const;    // An unassignable pointer to an unassignable int

int main(void)
{
  int i = 2;                                      // An assignable int
  int_const j = 3;                                // An unassignable int

  i = j;                                          // OK
  // j = i;                                       // ERROR; cannot assign to const

  int_ptr pointer_to_int;
  pointer_to_int = &i;                            // OK
  // pointer_to_int = &j;                         // ERROR; `int_const` cannot be safely converted to `int`

  int_const_ptr pointer_to_const_int;
  pointer_to_const_int = &i;                      // OK! `int` can be converted to `const int`
  pointer_to_const_int = &j;                      // OK

  int_ptr_const const_pointer_to_int = &i;        // OK
  // int_ptr_const const_pointer_to_int_2 = &j;   // ERROR; `int_const` cannot be converted to `int`

  *const_pointer_to_int = 2;                      // OK, constness of pointer does not affect constness of pointee
  // const_pointer_to_int = &i;                   // ERROR, cannot assign to const pointer

  int_const_ptr_const const_pointer_to_const_int_1 = &i;  // OK! `int` can be converted to `int const`
  int_const_ptr_const const_pointer_to_const_int_2 = &j;  // OK

  return 0;
}
```

Note in particular that `int` can be soundly converted to `int const`.
This is perhaps surprising:
doesn't this mean the compiler can make false assumptions?
For example, if we tell the compiler that a value is `const`,
might the compiler not cache the value?
As far as I understand, this is not the case,
because `const` doesn't actually mean has a "constant value".
`const` means "unassignable in this context".
Unassignable is not the same as immutable.

Some examples of `const` in the standard library:

```c
int atoi(const char * str);  // atoi promises not to assign to the characters in the array

// qsort demands a comparator which does not modify the things it compares
void qsort(void *base, size_t nitems, size_t size, int (*compar)(const void *, const void*));
```

(Note that the standard library uses the horrible `const char` construction.
You should read it as `char const`.)
