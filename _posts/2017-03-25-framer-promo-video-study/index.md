I was recently pointed to [framer.com](https://framer.com/). The homepage does an excellent job of marketing the product. By this, I mean that after visiting it, _I wanted to use/buy the product_. I didn't actually have a _great_ idea of what the product is for, but I wanted to use it. This, _I want to use the product_, is the aim of good advertising.

How does the homepage achieve this? First, it's a full screen autoplay video. It begins silently, but has the option of "Replay with sound". This avoids the risk of annoying your visitor with unwanted sound.

The entire video is 40 seconds. Short enough to keep my attention for the novelty of it.

When the video finishes, it seamlessly gives way to the website. Effectively, the "hero" text of the homepage is the last slide of the video.

Key to the video is _music_. It's punchy, energetic and makes the product seem _cool_. It has a very strong beat. The slides and animations of the video are timed to the beat.

The bass starts 5 seconds in. At 16 seconds, and again at 26 seconds, there is silence for one bar of the music. This breaks up the video and adds surprise.

It starts and ends with the Framer logo.

The first 27 seconds are animations of the product. The product itself makes animation stuff, so demos of the product itself are visually engaging. This gives way to the final 13 seconds which are mostly pure text slides. Here are the slides:

* "Motion"
* "Touch"
* "Real Data"
* "Intuitive Flows"
* "From simple apps ..."
* "... to new realities"
* (Here is a one-second-long flick through loads of animations, superfast. It seems to just be here to add the element of surprise!)
* "What will you design?"

These are too short and simple to be _informative_. They're just words vaguely related to the product. They set the scene, much like the music and brief clips of the product just set the scene. All these elements say, "This is how the product feels. It makes you feel _good_." Once the user likes how the product _feels_, they go on to find out what it _is_.
