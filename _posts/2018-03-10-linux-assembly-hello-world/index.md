  An x86-64 program that writes to stdout and exits.
---

A "hello world" program writes to stdout (calling `write`) then exits (calling `exit`).
The assembly program `hello.s` below does that on Linux x86-64.

```s
global _start

section .text

_start:
  mov rax, 1        ; write(
  mov rdi, 1        ;   STDOUT_FILENO,
  mov rsi, msg      ;   "Hello, world!\n",
  mov rdx, msglen   ;   sizeof("Hello, world!\n")
  syscall           ; );

  mov rax, 60       ; exit(
  mov rdi, 0        ;   EXIT_SUCCESS
  syscall           ; );

section .rodata
  msg: db "Hello, world!", 10
  msglen: equ $ - msg
```

To run it:

```console
$ nasm -f elf64 -o hello.o hello.s
$ ld -o hello hello.o
$ ./hello
Hello, world!
```

The first important document is [the x86-64 ABI specification](https://github.com/hjl-tools/x86-psABI/wiki/X86-psABI),
maintained by Intel.
(Weirdly, the official location for the ABI specification
is some random dude's personal GitHub account.
Welcome to the sketchy world of assembly.)
The ABI specification describes system calls in the abstract,
as it applies to any operating system.
Importantly:

* The system call number is put in `rax`.
* Arguments are put in the registers
  `rdi`, `rsi`, `rdx`, `rcx`, `r8` and `r9`,
  in that order.
* The system is called with the `syscall` instruction.
* The return value of the system call is in `rax`.
  An error is signalled by returning `-errno`.

The second document
is [the Linux 64-bit system call table](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/master/arch/x86/entry/syscalls/syscall_64.tbl).
This specifies the system call number for each Linux system call.
For our example, the `write` system call is `1` and `exit` is `60`.

Finally, you want the man pages for the system calls,
which tell you their signature, e.g.:

```c
#include <unistd.h>
ssize_t write(int fd, const void *buf, size_t count);
```

Armed with this, we know to:

* put the system call number `1` in `rax`
* put the `fd` argument in `rdi`
* put the `buf` argument in `rsi`
* put the `count` argument in `rdx`
* finally, call `syscall`
