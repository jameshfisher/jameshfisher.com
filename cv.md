**Let's build an amazing product and a profitable business!
Just give me customer contact and let me iterate.**
I've spent 12+ years in **full-stack dev.**
TypeScript, React, Postgres, AWS, etc.,
but I'm not fussy.
I've spent 5+ years in **product management,**
including Pusher Channels ($12M ARR),
and my two startups, [Vidrio](https://vidrio.netlify.app/) and [TigYog](https://tigyog.app/).

## Experience

<span class="details">Feb </span>2023 â€“ current:
<span class="summary">
Senior engineer at [Slite](https://slite.com/).
Slite lets employees document their knowledge, and search all company knowledge across Slack, Google Drive, etc.
I helped build Slite's AI writing and AI search features, maintained their rich text editor, and built several tools for faster product iteration.
</span>

<div class="details">

* Helped build **[Slite Ask](https://slite.com/ask)**, which is like Google Search for your company wiki, Slack, task-tracker etc. I built the iteration loop for improving answer quality: a set of test cases, with one-click reporting to add a bad answer to the test set, all graded using [promptfoo](https://github.com/promptfoo/promptfoo) and manually written rubrics. I used this to reduce hallucination and improve citation accuracy.
* Built **[AI Improve](https://slite.slite.page/p/JHQ7KXTnDXHdZQ)**, an editor feature that lets you improve your writing. I framed AI Improve as automating [_How People Read Online_](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/how-people-read-online/), the authority on optimizing web content for scanning. Uses GPT-4, a few prompting tricks, and operational transforms. Also built **[magic document formatter](https://slite.com/micro-apps/document-formatter/)**, a public variant that builds upon [Slite's free public templates](https://slite.com/templates).
* **Built [Slite Labs](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/christophepasquier_introducing-slite-labs-for-years-activity-7141337040926756864-SMSw/)**, which lets users try out experimental product improvements. Quickly adopted internally.
* **Built Slite's internal A/B test framework.** Assigns users to groups by hash; otherwise re-uses existing product analytics tools.
* Maintained Slite's rich text editor, which uses [Slate](https://docs.slatejs.org/).

<span class="summary">Technical Product Manager for [Pusher Channels](https://pusher.com/channels)
at [Pusher](https://pusher.com/).</span>
Companies use Pusher Channels to add realtime features to their apps
(e.g. chat messages, or New York Times live election night charts).
I moved into product management
to help grow the product.
During my time we grew from ~$8M ARR to ~$12M ARR.
<span class="details">
We had very limited resources and this was
an exercise in growing a product without adding new features.
I was the key link between Engineering, Sales and Marketing,
and the public representative of the product in many sales opportunities.

  but this has no message history.
  Pusher had built a replacement
  using [Raft](https://raft.github.io/) implementation for consistency and availability.
  This was written in [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/).
  I researched high latencies in the system,
  [finding that the root cause was garbage collection in GHC](https://making.pusher.com/latency-working-set-ghc-gc-pick-two/).
  This finding went surprisingly viral
