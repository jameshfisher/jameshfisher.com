title: "What is 'sequencing markets'?"
---

"Sequencing markets" is a strategy for growing a product. Begin with an extremely specific target market, and capture this before expanding. Here's my current market sequence plan for Vidrio:

1. iOS programming screencasts (e.g. "how to create an iOS app"). These people have Macs and are adventurous :)
1. Programming screencasts (e.g. "how to use nano")
1. Screencasts (e.g. "how to use Adobe Premiere Pro")
1. Recorded presentations (e.g. "How Golang's GC works")
1. Live presentations
1. Two-way conversations
