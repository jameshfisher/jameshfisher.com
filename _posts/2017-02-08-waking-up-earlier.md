title: "Waking up earlier"
---

This ain't just a tech blog. It's a way to organize my life. One thing I've learned from my "blog every day" pledge is that the primary tool for life organization is _daily routine_. I don't think mine is optimal, so today I'm re-thinking it.

There are four key numbers to my daily routine: _wake, work, leave, sleep_. Currently, they are:

```
wake  work  leave sleep
08:30 10:00 18:30 00:00
```

Here's the routine visually:

What's wrong with this routine?

* Too much sleep; not enough quality sleep. (Sleeping during daylight.)
* My morning routine omits essential elements (often breakfast).
* My lunch is significantly later than the normal working 12:30 lunch.
* I arrive at work too late, and leave work too late.
* It's not aligned with the sun. It's fundamentally aligned with work.
* I work long hours but don't get much done in them.

I'm going to:

* Remove 60 minutes from the end of my work day. I don't believe that time is productive; I do most work in the morning.
* Remove 30 minutes at the end of my sleep. I don't believe it's quality sleep (during daylight).
* Add 60 minutes to my morning routine.
* Add 30 minutes to my evening routine.
* Shift the entire routine so that my sleep ends around daybreak.

This gives me the key numbers:

```
wake  work  leave sleep
06:30 09:00 16:30 22:30
```
