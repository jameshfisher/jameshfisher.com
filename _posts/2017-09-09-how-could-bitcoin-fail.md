title: How could Bitcoin fail?
tags: []

I'm intending to increase the amount of time and money I invest in cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin.
Investment is a bet:
I'm betting that the long-term value of Bitcoin (many years ahead)
will be larger than it is in 2017.
It's worth considering the possible ways in which Bitcoin could fail.
A bet on Bitcoin is a bet that all of these threats won't happen.

* **Worse is better.**
  Bitcoin might be a theoretically superior system to today's banking system.
  But theoretical superiority does not mean success.
  Maybe ACH and banks work well enough.
  Bitcoin could shrink from its hype to become a nerdy curiosity,
  like Tor or web-of-trust.
* **Impracticality.**
  Maybe Bitcoin can't be made convenient enough to become a primary payment mechanism.
  Maybe people can't wrap their heads around enough to use it,
  or to trust themselves to use it.
  Maybe mainstream sellers never bother adopting it.
* **Illegality.**
  Bitcoin could be banned.
  States have shown some effectiveness in applying the law to cryptography.
  China is trying to stamp out cryptocurrency exchanges at the moment.
* **Incorrectness.**
  Someone could discover that
  Bitcoin doesn't have its claimed (mathematical, cryptographic, game-theoretic) properties.
  Or more mundanely, someone discovers a critical bug and exploits it.
* **A 51% organization.**
  One day, 51%+ of computing power might be controlled by a single organization.
  The First Persian Empire once controlled 44% of all people; this could happen again.
  Alternatively, a breakthrough in quantum computing
  could radically centralize computing power.
* **Technological collapse.**
  Bitcoin relies on computers, the Internet, and a constant electricity supply.
  By comparison, gold does not rely on much except shared belief.
