  Hired a cleaning service that takes a third of the hourly rate.

Today I booked a cleaner for my flat. When I last did this around 2014, I think Gumtree was the main source of cleaning jobs. Now a load of cleaning services have popped up which follow the Uber middleman pattern. [Hassle](https://hassle.com/uk/london) says "All our independent London cleaners are self-employed"; they charge £12/hr. [Handy](https://www.handy.com/cleaning-services/london) similarly says they have "top-quality, pre-screened independent service professionals". [Housekeep](https://housekeep.com/) pays its workers £8.50 per hour, and charges £12.50 per hour, and so takes about a 1/3 cut.

I'm not sure I like using these services, mainly because of the massive cut they take. But it sure is convenient, so I went with Handy.
