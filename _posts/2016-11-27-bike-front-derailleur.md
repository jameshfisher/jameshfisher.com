  The front derailleur (Shimano FD-2203) is incompatible with the triple
  crankset, causing shifting issues. A compatible front derailleur like Shimano
  FD-5603 may be needed to resolve the problem.

I bought a bike from EBay. It has decent components, but they seem mashed together incompatibly. My front derailleur doesn't shift properly.

I tried adjusting the front derailleur, with little success. The clearance to the big ring is always than 1mm (too little).

A mechanic told me that my front derailleur is for a double-ring crankset, and therefore incompatible with my triple-ring. However, I'm not sure whether the mechanic is right. The derailleur is a [Shimano FD-2203](http://si.shimano.com/#models/1961), the manual of which suggests it can work with a triple-ring.

Here are the components:

* Front derailleur: [Shimano FD-2203](http://si.shimano.com/#models/1961).
* Rear derailleur: [Shimano Ultegra RD-6600](http://si.shimano.com/#models/1706).
* Chainrings: Shimano SuperGlide with 52, 42 and 30 teeth. (They're marked "Shimano SG A-52-42-30".)
* Cassette: [Shimano CS-5600](http://si.shimano.com/#models/1749), 10-speed.
* Shifters: [Shimano 105 “FlightDeck” ST-5600](http://si.shimano.com/#models/1887).
* Bottom bracket: marked "Shimano, EE, Japan VIA, BC.1.37, 68".
* Frame:

  * The seller said "I think it's made by [Toyo](http://toyoframe.com/en/)", but the frame lacks markings suggesting this.
  * It has the frame number "CM3280024".
  * It's marked "Aluminum Kinesis 6061".

There is a mixture of different Shimano series here: 2203, 6600, 5600.

From the manuals, the main "incompatibilities" I noticed are:

* The shifters (ST-5600) want either FD-5600 or FD-5603 front derailleur, but mine is FD-2203!
* The front derailleur (FD-2203) wants ST-3303 shifters, but mine are ST-5600!
* The front derailleur (FD-2203) wants 24 gears, but I have 30!
* The front derailleur (FD-2203) wants RD-2200 rear derailleur, but mine is RD-6600!

The front derailleur looks like the impostor, so maybe I should replace that - but what with?

The manual for the [FD-5600](http://si.shimano.com/#models/1765) wants 20 gears, so that doesn't work.

The manual for the [FD-5603](http://si.shimano.com/#models/1766), suggested by the shifters, wants:

* ST-5600 shifters - OK!
* 30 gears - OK!
* Front chainwheel FC-5603 - ???
* Rear derailleur - RD-5600-GS - ???
* Front chainwheel tooth difference of 20 or less - NO, I have a difference of 22!

Is this the cause of my problems?
