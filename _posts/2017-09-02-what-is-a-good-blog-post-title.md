tags: []
summary: >-
  To write a viral blog post title, use a question format, focus on a single
  topic, and employ clickbait tactics to pique readers' curiosity.

I now have 256 blog posts.
Each one has a title.
I suspect the success of a blog post depends a lot on its title.
Let's analyze which titles worked well,
and find some principles for how to choose a good title.

* My post popular posts, by far, are
  ["What is `mode_t`?"](/2017/02/24/what-is-mode_t/) and
  ["Generating Intel and AT&T assembly with `clang`"](/2017/02/19/clang-assembly-att-intel/).
  This seems a bit arbitrary; they were low-effort posts.

* Almost all people get to this site from Google search.
  I should optimize for Google search.

* Most of the most popular posts have a title structured as a question.
  "What is `mode_t`?"
  "What are Lamport timestamps?"
  "What is STUN?"
  I should phrase more posts as questions.
  This also gives me more focus for the post: answer the question!

* Most popular posts are on a single specific topic.
  "What is X?"

* Good titles don't give the game away!
  That is, they're CLICKBAIT.
  Questions are natural clickbait, because the question doesn't contain the answer!
