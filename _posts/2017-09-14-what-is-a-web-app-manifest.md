title: What is a Web App Manifest?
tags: []
---

We use "web app" to describe web pages which are more like programs.
This has always been pretty informal and ambiguous
(take a slideshow in a news story; is it a web app or a web page?).
The "Web App Manifest" attempts to formalize the distinction, and says that
a "web app" is any web page with a `<link rel="manifest" href="/manifest.json"/>`,
where `/manifest.json` is a JSON file with a bunch of information about the web app,
for example:

```json
{
  "name": "jameshfisher.com",
  "start_url": "/",
  "icons": [
    {
      "src": "/assets/jim_144.png",
      "sizes": "144x144",
      "type": "image/png"
    }
  ],
  "display": "standalone",
  "gcm_sender_id": "432193615425"
}
```

The manifest gives the web app things which make it more like "real applications", like:

* Ability to be added to a "homescreen"
* Icons for launching
* Configuration for advanced features, like web push
* Links to other applications in other "app stores"

It's not clear to me why all this stuff has to go in a separate JSON file.
It could all go directly in the `<meta>` tags for the page.
We already have a million different `<meta>` tags for other things.

In Chrome, you can see the contents of the manifest
in Developer Tools under Application > Manifest.
On thing you can do here is "Add to homescreen".
Now this blog can be on your homescreen,
which I'm sure you've all been waiting for.
