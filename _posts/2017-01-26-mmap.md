title: "What is `mmap` in C?"
---

The functions `malloc`, `free` and friends are not system calls. They are library functions. Under the hood, the system calls they use are `mmap` and `munmap`. (Older implementations use `brk` or `brk`; I'll cover that in future.)

The `mmap` syscall lets the program manipulate _virtual memory_. The address space is divided into a number of _pages_. (On my machine, each page is 4096 bytes long.) Each page can be _mapped_ to some underlying resource. Here, we use `mmap` to map a page of virtual address space to a block of hardware memory. (`mmap` can also map the page to a file, which can be a much more convenient interface to file manipulation.)

Here's an example:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <sys/mman.h>
#include <unistd.h>

int main(void) {
  size_t pagesize = getpagesize();

  printf("System page size: %zu bytes\n", pagesize);

  char * region = mmap(
    (void*) (pagesize * (1 << 20)),   // Map from the start of the 2^20th page
    pagesize,                         // for one page length
    PROT_READ|PROT_WRITE|PROT_EXEC,
    MAP_ANON|MAP_PRIVATE,             // to a private block of hardware memory
    0,
    0
  );
  if (region == MAP_FAILED) {
    perror("Could not mmap");
    return 1;
  }

  strcpy(region, "Hello, world!");

  printf("Contents of region: %s\n", region);

  int unmap_result = munmap(region, 1 << 10);
  if (unmap_result != 0) {
    perror("Could not munmap");
    return 1;
  }
  // getpagesize
  return 0;
}
```

This prints:

```
% ./a.out
System page size: 4096 bytes
Contents of region: Hello, world!
```
