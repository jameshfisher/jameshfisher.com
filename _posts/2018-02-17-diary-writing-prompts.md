title: "Diary writing prompts"
---

[I began this year writing a diary entry every day](https://github.com/jameshfisher/encrypted-diary).
My diary writing has dropped off recently.
One reason is that my entries were excessively mundane;
I would usually concentrate on the day's activities
to the detriment of larger topics.

One way to reinvigorate my diary writing might be
to have a prompt for each entry.
I've added this feature, which looks like this:

```console
$ diary prompt
Prompt: Describe someone you know.
Start writing. EOF (Ctrl-D) finishes the entry.
```

The prompt is taken randomly from a `prompts` file,
which looks like this:

```
Recall an old memory.
Describe someone you know.
Recall something someone said recently.
```

I want a much larger repertoire of prompts than the three above.
I'll experiment with different prompts to see which are effective,
i.e. which ones lead to interesting writing.
