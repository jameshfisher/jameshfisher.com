After Will Sewell and I gave our "Golang's realtime garbage collector" talk at The Realtime Guild,
Zan Markan (our colleague) referred us to [Nic Jackson](https://twitter.com/sheriffjackson)
who works at [Not On The High Street](https://www.notonthehighstreet.com/).
They were organising a little internal conference, "NotHSCon", in their Richmond office.
